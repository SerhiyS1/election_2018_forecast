Here is my forecast.  Democrats will win the House of Representatives but will lose the Senate.

Let's talk about the House of Representatives.  According to FiveThirtyEight, there is an 80% chance that the Democrats gain 21 to 59 seats in the House. The average gain, as projected by FiveThirtyEight, is 39 Democratic seats.  My prediction is that Democrats win the House and gain 50 seats.  The data about early voting increasing at such high rates among young people inclines me to predict that Democrats will perform better than we expect. 

The Senate, however, does not look as good for the Democrats.  The current breakdown is 51 R - 49 D, but the FiveThirtyEight model predicts an average gain of 0.7 seats for the Republicans.  My prediction is that Democrats will lose the Senate and lose 1 seat.  I would not be too shocked if Beto pulls the greatest political upset since President Trump and defeats Republican Senator Ted Cruz in Texas.
